## Design Patterns
### 1. **MVC Architecture**
- The application follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
- Models represent the data structures and business logic.
- Views are responsible for rendering the user interface.
- Controllers handle user input and application flow.

### 2. **Service Layer**
- Business logic is encapsulated in service classes.
- Services interact with models and other services to perform operations.
- Services are reusable and testable components of the application.

### 3. **Repository Pattern**
- Database operations are abstracted using repository classes.
- Repositories provide a clean interface for interacting with the database.
- Repositories are used by services to access and manipulate data.
